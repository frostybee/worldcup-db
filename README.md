# The Fjelstul World Cup MySQL/MariaDB Database

This repository contains a MySQL/MariaDB port of the [Fjelstul World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup), a comprehensive database about the FIFA World Cup created by Joshua C. Fjelstul that covers all `22` men's tournaments (1930-2022) and all `8` women's tournaments (1991-2019). The database includes `27` datasets (over 1.58  million data points) that cover all aspects of the World Cup.

The data and original structure of the database tables and their relationships were not altered. However, modifications have been made to fields' data types to make them MySQL compliant.  

## Documentation

To know more about the structure of the tables and the meaning of their content, you can refer to the [Codebook](docs/world-cup-codebook.pdf).

However, to read the full documentation and have access to the raw data, please visit the [Fjelstul World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup) repository.

## How Do I Use this Database?

1. Clone this repository
2. Using your favorite MySQL GUI client, import the following files in order:
   - `sql/worldcup.schema.sql` contains the table structure
   - `sql/worldcup.data.sql` contains the INSERT statements

Alternatively, you can import the `World Cup` database using MySQL's CLI by executing the following commands:

```bash
mysql -u <username> -p <password> < worldcup.schema.sql
```

Then,

```bash
mysql -u <username> -p <password> worldcup < worldcup.data.sql
```

**`NOTE:`** There is no need to create a database prior to importing the above .sql scripts as a `worldcup` MySQL database will be created automatically.

Once imported, the following tables should be created:

```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> use worldcup;
Database changed
MariaDB [worldcup]> select table_name as "Table Name", table_rows  AS "Row Count" FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'worldcup';
